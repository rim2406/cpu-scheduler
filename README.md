- This project implements various **CPU scheduling algorithms** in C++.  
- Supported algorithms: **FCFS, Round Robin, SPN, SRT, HRRN, Feedback, and Aging**.  
- Each algorithm manages CPU time allocation to optimize performance.  
- **Round Robin and Aging** allow variable time quantum adjustments.  
- **Aging** prevents starvation by increasing process priority over time.  
- Users install by **cloning the repository, compiling with `make`, and running the executable**.  
- Input includes **scheduling type, policies, simulation time, and process details**.  
- The project allows **analysis and visualization of scheduling policies**.  
- Check the repository for **test cases**.
